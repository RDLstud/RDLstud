## Hi, I'm Roberto 👋

I’m a Master’s student in Data Science with a B.Sc. in Physics, currently exploring how to turn data into actionable insights by combining a strong quantitative background with real-world applications.


Over the past year, I've focused on:

- Applying statistics and machine learning to extract meaning from complex datasets  
- Exploring deep learning for modeling and prediction tasks  
- Developing image preprocessing pipelines, especially in medical and physical-science contexts  
- Designing and managing databases to support scalable data workflows  

What drives me is the opportunity to work on **real case studies**, where I can contribute to solving meaningful problems from end to end. I'm passionate about understanding the full lifecycle of a data science problem — from messy raw data to interpretable, impactful results.

I'm always open to:

- Collaborating on innovative data projects  
- Working in interdisciplinary teams  
- Learning new programming languages, tools, and communication strategies  

Let’s build something impactful together.
